  abstract = {The book is an ideal resource for learning the interdisciplinary skills needed for interaction design, human-computer interaction, information design, web design and ubiquitous computing. It deals with a broad scope of issues, topics and paradigms that has traditionally been the scope of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design (ID). The book covers psychological and social aspects of users, interaction styles, user requirements, design approaches, usability and evaluation, traditional and future interface paradigms and the role of theory in informing design. The topics will be grounded in the design process and the aim is to present relevant issues in an integrated and coherent way, rather than assembling a collection of chapters on individual HCI topics.},

abstract = {There is a growing recognition of excessive, compulsive, and hasty use of technology as an emerging form of problematic behavior affecting individuals' emotional, social, and occupational wellbeing. Smartphone overuse, in particular, has been linked to negative effects on users' quality of life, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and loss in productivity. One strategy to help regulate digital usage and, potentially, increase digital wellbeing is to devise smartphone applications to collect data about usage and increase users' awareness of it and enable them to set limits and alert users accordingly. However, such applications have not been extensively evaluated from the users' perspective and whether they help the basic requirements for digital wellbeing. In this paper, we examine the quality of the emerging family of digital wellbeing smartphone applications from the users' perspective and based on persuasive design and established behavioral change theories. We performed a thematic analysis on the users’ reviews on two popular applications, SPACE Break Phone Addiction and Google Digital Wellbeing (GDW). We report on the factors influencing user acceptance and rejection towards digital wellbeing applications and identify possible challenges and opportunities to improve their design and role in future releases.}

@online{8976353,
  abstract = {In May 2018, Google presented a new initiative called Digital wellbeing at their annual developer conference, Google I/O. Digital wellbeing consists of part a new design philosophy guiding the company’s products, part a set of tools to improve people’s relationship with digital technology. Using an STS influenced approach, this thesis seeks to better understand what role Google thinks technology should play in everyday life. This is done by analyzing the keynote presentation of Google I/O 2018, drawing from theories on the social shaping of technology and critical modernity theory, bringing a contextualized understanding of the visions presented on stage and their relation to the products and services that are shown. The analysis finds the relationship between humans and technology articulated in two different, and not so easily conjoined ways. One the one hand, the Digital wellbeing initiative presents digital technology as something one can step in and out of, a distinct domain of the everyday life, put in contrast to “the real world”. We can measure and limit our time spent with technology, and the applications provided by the Digital wellbeing initiative are presented as means for gaining control over our devices as well as ourselves. Wellbeing in this sense is to be an autonomous subject, able to use technological devices to increase efficiency, and to have the power to disconnect whenever needed. On the other hand, the overall vision brought by Google suggests a situation where digital technology is fully integrated into daily life, no longer bound to particular devices and always available by voice. It’s envisioned as an omnipresent servant that covers more tasks and domains with every software update. The ideals of efficiency and time-saving that permeates Google’s vision of technology encourage users to give away control to Google in order to gain control over their time. The lack of control over time spent with technology that users report, is turned into an argument for potentially giving up further control. In the first definition, AI means artificial, in the second, intelligence.},

The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required to achieve desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

In addition, it suggested cutting off the values by gender in order to determine smartphone addiction and elaborate the characteristics of smartphone usage in adolescents.  Method A set of questionnaires were provided to a total of 540 selected participants from April to May of 2013. The participants consisted of 343 boys and 197 girls, and their average age was 14.5 years old. The content validity was performed on a selection of shortened items, while an internal-consistency test was conducted for the verification of its reliability. The concurrent validity was confirmed using SAS, SAPS and KS-scale. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted to suggest cut-off.  Results The 10 final questions were selected using content validity. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.911. The SAS-SV was significantly correlated with the SAS, SAPS and KS-scale. The SAS-SV scores of gender (p<.001) and self-evaluation of smartphone addiction (p<.001) showed significant difference. The ROC analysis results showed an area under a curve (AUC) value of 0.963(0.888–1.000), a cut-off value of 31, sensitivity value of 0.867 and specificity value of 0.893 in boys while an AUC value of 0.947(0.887–1.000), a cut-off value of 33, sensitivity value of 0.875, and a specificity value of 0.886 in girls.  Conclusions The SAS-SV showed good reliability and validity for the assessment of smartphone addiction. The smartphone addiction scale short version, which was developed and validated in this study, could be used efficiently for the evaluation of smartphone addiction in community and research areas.},
